      <h2>In Memoriam</h2>
      <p>DJ Berger was a talented California-based quilt artist, a longtime member of the North Bay-based <a href="https://www.mqsc.org/">Moonlight Quilters' group</a>, the <a         href="https://www.santarosaquiltguild.org/">Santa Rosa Quilt Guild</a>, Tuesday Night Therapy, and The Bad Girls. She began quilting in the late 1970s, and her later works were featured in quilting magazines and in the books <cite>Faces & Places: Images in Appliqu√©</cite> by Charlotte Warr Andersen and <cite>Remembering Life at Home: Collected Works From the WWII Home Front Quilts Project</cite>, a publication by the <a href="https://rosietheriveter.org/">Rosie the Riveter Trust</a>.</p>

      <p>DJ spent her career as a nurse caring for those in need, and passed away in January 2019, with her dearest friend Ann at her side. She left her three sons a legacy of kindness, compassion for others, and a desire to serve and be useful to the world. She also left a small <em>mountain</em> of quilts, which were shared among friends, family, and the rabbi who helped to gently guide her to peace. It doesn't seem right to keep the wealth of her artworks confined to such a small circle, and so this site is intended to share her decades of love and labor with the world.</p>

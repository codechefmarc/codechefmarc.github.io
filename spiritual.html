    <h2>Spiritual Journey</h2>
    <p>DJ grew up in a WASP family with Midwestern values, but like many in the 1960s, was seeking answers beyond what she had been raised with. She majored in Religious Studies at UC Santa Barbara, and was drawn to Judaism. She would go on to convert to the faith and to complete a graduate degree at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles, becoming a Jewish teacher.</p> <p>While her faith and her Jewish identity remained central throughout her life, in later years she—like many other Jews of her generation—was intrigued by the philosophical disciplines of Buddhism, and found that they were compatible with her nondualistic interpretation of Judaism. DJ was a lifelong advocate of peace, equity and justice, values that she worked to instill in her children, and regularly taught at her seder table. In her absence, her family strives to continue to live up to and pass on these values.</p>

Top center is a vase with a KoKopeli design and a woven wedding basket. Sunwise, around the quilt: a Weaver with traditional silver jewelry, the morning pollen blessing, Mesa Verde, Ship Rock, and a Navajo sand painter."</td>

    <p class="about">"Quilting for me is my singing and dancing. I have stories and dreams and thoughts and concerns and they wind up in cloth. I hope you begin to understand what drives a quilt artist to make these special quilts. </p>
<p>To be a spiritual person is to see the world deeply and with a daily freshness and sparkle. Every day occurrences can be elevated to the extraordinary with this simple mindset. It was asked of writers, “What shall I write about?” and writers said, “Write what you love”. It was asked of Quilt Artists, “What shall I quilt about?” The answers are always “Quilt what you love.” Quilt what is fascinating to you. Quilt your sadness, quilt your questions, quilt what is in your heart and soul. You cannot be disappointed in choosing a topic that you love or think about often. What makes you wonder? What are you excited about?</p>
  <p>There is a world of subjects to quilt about. Open your eyes and open your heart. What do you see? What do you feel? My ideas come from what I see or read or hear, from what I worry about or what I celebrate. The inspiration can come from fabric or from the front page of a newspaper.</p>
  <p>The usual flash of inspiration for many quilters is THE FABRIC. Going to a quilt shop with friends is a joyous occasion. Seeing all the new fabrics or new books starts the creative juices going, and it can be dangerous for one who is on a budget! Before you go, take a quick tour of your present stash. What do you love? What are you bored with? What do you have too much of? This can usually help you to focus on your next project when you are enthralled with the shop’s wares. Take a camera, not only for the quilts shown, but for the range of fabrics you are interested in. (But always ask permission first.) Seeing fabrics through a camera lens can focus ideas, or find problems. I often look for intricate fabrics that have many repeats, so that I can make quilts like “Blue Hexagons”. I especially love the fabrics created by Peggy O'Toole for Robert Kaufman. They are intricate and awesome.</p>
  <p>Faith is a great inspiration for art world wide. I am known for my Jewish quilts. I was lucky enough in the late 60’s to have entered Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles. This graduate school began the specific educational process for the rabbinate. There also were programs for Jewish Education and Jewish Library Science. I graduated with certificate degrees in the last two fields as I felt I couldn’t handle death and dying issues. I love the old saying “Gd laughs when we make plans” as my next career was in nursing and I specialized in end of life care.  In my Jewish studies I felt I couldn’t learn enough! I always had questions followed by more questions. It was exhilarating."</p>
  <p><h2>On Mistakes</h2>
<p>"Yes, we all make them. Many of us proclaim them to the world but that is not necessary. What is necessary is that we learn from them, and when we can, have the courage to change what is needed. I recently ripped out the quilting from a quilt which was half quilted. Not easy. But i knew I never would have been happy with the batting I first chose.  In time your mistakes will decrease but there will always be mistakes, it is just the human thing to do.  In a class I was taking a teacher explained “Enjoy the mistakes. If they are not major and don’t affect the whole endeavor you may not have to change it. It shows that a person, not a machine, made this”!  A mistake may give the quilt some sparkle. A mistake may also turn the quilt into another idea which is even better. Small tip…don’t criticize a quilt when others are near, one may be the artist!"
</p>
  <h2>Why I make traditional quilts</h2>
<p>"Sometimes I just want to let my mind be quiet so I am drawn to make traditional quilts at times.  I may have a fabric or a few fabrics I want to showcase,  I have found that traditional quilts give my mind order.  I think that is one of the reasons why early quilting women enjoyed making them.  A traditional quilt can ease you into calmness, and take you away from the day’s work and problems.  I am affected by a sleep disorder.  In my times of early morning insomnia I made a traditional quilt of red and white half square triangles.  Over and over again I sewed half square triangles hoping for sleep. When I had sewn it together I couldn’t believe what power “Lady in Red”  had with it’s rote simplicity and repetition. Star from the Sea is made of many diamonds and was also “an early morning work”."</p></main>

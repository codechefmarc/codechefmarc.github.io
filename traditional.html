    <h2>The Circle Back to the Traditional</h2>
    <p>Despite her admiration for a number of current and historical fiber and quilting artists, it took many years and a lot of lovingly stern friends for DJ to see herself as an artist. Even once she did, there was always a lot of self-deprecation. After many rewards and recognitions, she started to come around to seeing herself as accomplished -- imposter syndrome is a beast! -- and in 2007, she was chosen as the keynote speaker for the Empty Spools Quilting Retreat and Seminar at Asilomar, a tremendous honor for a quilter, and one that meant the world to DJ. </p>
    <p>One of her sons being a DJ in college introduced her to techno, trip hop, and electropop, which she loved to listen to while quilting. She was a huge fan of The Crystal Method. She found immense joy and intellectual stimulation in the geometries of traditional quilting, as well as the challenges of "painting with fabric" for the nontraditional designs.</p>

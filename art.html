   <section class="journey">
    <h2>Artistic Journey</h2>
    <p>DJ initially began quilting in the late 1970s, and like most people, initially viewed it as a craft, not an art form. That attitude didn't last long, as she quickly realized that modern quilting had escaped the bonds of simple geometry, and taken on organic forms, varied textures, layering and more. She was quickly hooked, and it became a richly expressive outlet for her to work through her memories, fears, and her hopes and worries about the future.</p>

Air is shown by the wind , Fire by the sun on the upper right, Earth is shown at the bottom of the quilt with layers of soil, rock. Plants are also quilted in this area. Water is quilted with the Sashiko stitch. The Celtic knots are not made by bias strips but individually cut to get the correct shading and pointy shapes.  I was inspired when I saw a fallen oak tree showing its gnarly roots."</td>
